        Attention:
        You are only allowed to use the functions that are delimited by triple backticks.
        You are not allowed to use any other hypothetical functions.

objects = ['clothespile', 'microwave', 'pillow', 'closetdrawer', 'cutleryfork', 'keyboard', 'cabinet', 'towelrack', 'bench', 'kitchentable', 'wallshelf', 'faucet', 'mug', 'lightswitch', 'closet', 'radio', 'sofa', 'fryingpan', 'toothbrush', 'powersocket', 'barsoap', 'window', 'computer', 'doorjamb', 'washingmachine', 'plum', 'mousemat', 'salmon', 'coffeemaker', 'perfume', 'condimentshaker', 'tablelamp', 'stove', 'apple', 'orchid', 'bedroom', 'remotecontrol', 'kitchen', 'painkillers', 'dishwashingliquid', 'peach', 'bellpepper', 'hanger', 'fridge', 'towel', 'waterglass', 'chocolatesyrup', 'cupcake', 'creamybuns', 'photoframe', 'clothesshirt', 'candle', 'garbagecan', 'whippedcream', 'bed', 'chips', 'bathroom', 'stovefan', 'plate', 'paper', 'bookshelf', 'bathroomcounter', 'toilet', 'rug', 'wallpictureframe', 'box', 'deodorant', 'lime', 'desk', 'kitchencabinet', 'hairproduct', 'mouse', 'condimentbottle', 'clothespants', 'wineglass', 'coffeepot', 'folder', 'toaster', 'bathtub', 'tv', 'facecream', 'cellphone', 'tvstand', 'livingroom', 'cereal', 'dishbowl', 'stall', 'curtains', 'bathroomcabinet', 'washingsponge', 'kitchencounter', 'crackers', 'ceiling', 'coffeetable', 'cutleryknife', 'chair', 'clock', 'sink', 'kitchencounterdrawer', 'toothpaste', 'walllamp', 'wallphone', 'breadslice', 'pie', 'candybar', 'cpuscreen', 'bananas', 'floor', 'slippers', 'wall', 'door', 'oventray', 'ceilinglamp', 'book', 'nightstand']
	Here is the relationship between the objects and their locations:
    You can find chips in the kitchen.
    You can find coffeetable in the kitchen.
    You can find cupcake in the bedroom.
    You can find sink in the kitchen.
    You can find faucet in the kitchen.
    You should find the cupcake everywhere if you cannot find the cupcake,then grab it.
    The most important things you must follow:
    Note that before you search for a object, you must go to the room where the object is located. This is to ensure that you can find it in the correct location.
    When you're searching for something, you must first locate it based on the information I provide you.
    Add 'assert' after finding an object to ensure the success rate of grabbing the object or being close enough to it.
    You must give your complete solution without missing any steps or I will punish you.
    Do not call the function at last.    
    
    You should give your analysis and find the sequence of steps,then give your function after learning from the examples.
    Here are the examples you need to learn:

----Test set tasks----
['watch tv']
Total: 1 tasks

----PROMPT for state check----
You see: microwave is OFF and CLOSED, lightswitch is ON, cereal, bookshelf, book is CLOSED, bookshelf ON floor, microwave ON kitchencounterdrawer, salmon ON microwave, book INSIDE bookshelf, dishbowl INSIDE bookshelf, clothespile INSIDE bookshelf, bananas INSIDE bookshelf, box ON bookshelf, book ON kitchentable, dishbowl ON bookshelf, condimentshaker INSIDE bookshelf, box INSIDE bookshelf, character HOLD_RH book, book ON rug, cereal ON wallshelf, plate INSIDE microwave, condimentbottle INSIDE bookshelf, microwave ON kitchencounter, paper INSIDE bookshelf

assert('close' to 'mug' )
False
assert('close' to 'microwave' )
True
assert('book' is 'closed' )
True
assert('lightswitch' is 'OFF')
False
assert('book' in 'bookshelf')
True
assert('book' in 'hands')
True
assert('cereal' on 'bookshelf')
False

--Executing task: watch tv--
Plan:  To command the robot to function properly, I need to observe the relationship between the objects and their locations. After analyzing the examples provided, I can see that each action involves walking to a specified location, finding an object, and then performing an action on the object.

Based on this, I can create a function to command the robot to perform the "watch_tv" action:

```python
def watch_tv():
    # 0: walk to living room
    walk('livingroom')
    # 1: find TV
    find('tv')
    # 2: turn on TV
    assert('close' to 'tv

<char0> [walk] <livingroom> (335)
<char0> [find] <tv> (426)
State check:
You see: tv is OFF, tvstand, tv ON tvstand.
assert('close' to 'tv
Sorry,

unsatisfied state conditions: relations: set(), object states: {'tv ON'}
