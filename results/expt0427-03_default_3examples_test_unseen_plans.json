{"eat chips on the sofa": "It looks like you've got a good start on your functions for the household robot! For the `eat_chips_on_the_sofa` function, we can follow a similar structure to the previous functions:\n\n```python\ndef eat_chips_on_the_sofa():\n    # 0: walk to living room\n    walk('livingroom')\n    # 1: find chips\n    find('chips')\n    # 2: grab chips\n    assert('close' to 'chips')\n        else: find('chips')\n    grab('chips')\n    # 3: find sofa\n    find('sofa')\n    # 4: sit on the sofa\n    assert('close' to 'sofa' )  \n        else: find('sofa')\n    sit('sofa')\n    # 5: eat chips\n    assert('chips' in 'hands' )\n        else: find('chips')\n        else: grab('chips')\n    # 6: Done\n\n# Example usage\neat_chips_on_the_sofa()\n```\n\nThis function follows a similar structure to the others, ensuring that the robot walks to the living room, finds the chips, grabs them, finds the sofa, sits on it, and then eats the chips. You can adjust the details and actions as needed!", "put salmon in the fridge": "It seems like you want to complete the `put_salmon_in_the_fridge()` function based on the provided template.
