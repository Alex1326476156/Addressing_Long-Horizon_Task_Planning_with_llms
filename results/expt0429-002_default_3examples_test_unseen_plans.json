{"eat chips on the sofa": "To eat chips on the sofa, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Walk to the kitchen to find the chips.\n2. Find the chips.\n3. Grab the chips.\n4. Walk to the living room (sofa).\n5. Sit on the sofa.\n6. Open the packet of chips.\n7. Eat the chips.\n8. Stand up from the sofa.\n\nHere's how we can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef eat_chips_on_the_sofa():\n    # 0: walk to kitchen\n    walk('kitchen')\n    # 1: find chips\n    find('chips')\n    # 2: grab chips\n    assert('close' to 'chips')\n        else: find('chips')\n    grab('chips')\n    # 3: walk to living room (sofa)\n    walk('livingroom')\n    # 4: sit on sofa\n    sit('sofa')\n    # 5: open packet of chips\n    find('chips')\n    assert('chips' in 'hands')\n        else: find('chips')\n    open('chips')\n    # 6: eat chips\n    assert('chips' is 'opened')\n        else: open('chips')\n    eat('chips')\n    # 7: stand up from sofa\n    standup()\n    # 8: Done\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures we follow the required steps in logical order and meet all the specified conditions.", "put salmon in the fridge": "Here's the function for putting salmon in the fridge:\n\n```python\ndef put_salmon_in_the_fridge():\n    # 0: walk to kitchen\n    walk('kitchen')\n    # 1: find salmon\n    find('salmon')\n    # 2: grab salmon\n    assert('close' to 'salmon')\n    else: find('salmon')\n    grab('salmon')\n    # 3: find fridge\n    find('fridge')\n    # 4: open fridge\n    assert('close' to 'fridge')\n    else: find('fridge')\n    assert('fridge' is 'closed')\n    else: close('fridge')\n    open('fridge')\n    # 5: put salmon in fridge\n    assert('salmon' in 'hands')\n    else: find('salmon')\n    else: grab('salmon')\n    assert('close' to 'fridge')\n    else: find('fridge')\n    assert('fridge' is 'opened')\n    else: open('fridge')\n    putin('salmon', 'fridge')\n    # 6: close fridge\n    assert('close' to 'fridge')\n    else: find('fridge')\n    assert('fridge' is 'opened')\n    else: open('fridge')\n    close('fridge')\n    # 7: Done\n```\n\nThis function follows the logical order of actions specified, starting from walking to the kitchen, finding the salmon, grabbing it, finding the fridge, opening the fridge, putting the salmon inside, and then closing the fridge."}
