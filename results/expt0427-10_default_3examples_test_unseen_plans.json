{"eat chips on the sofa": "It looks like you're setting up some tasks for a household robot! Eating chips on the sofa sounds like a relaxing activity.

Since the prompt doesn't provide a specific action for eating, you might imagine actions like \"consume\", \"eat\", or \"snack\". You could also simulate reaching for the chips and bringing them to the mouth. If you have a specific action in mind for eating, let me know and I can incorporate it!", "put salmon in the fridge": "It seems like you're in the middle of defining functions for various household tasks for a robot.

Let me know if you need further assistance!", "bring coffeepot and cupcake to the coffee table": "It seems like you're creating functions for a household robot to perform various tasks in a household environment. Let's continue with the task \"bring_coffeepot_and_cupcake_to_the_coffee_table()\".

It follows the same structure as the previous functions, ensuring that the robot walks to the appropriate rooms, finds the objects, grabs them, and then puts them on the coffee table.", "microwave salmon": "It looks like you're setting up a sequence of actions for a household robot to perform various tasks within a household environment. The functions you've provided are well-structured and seem to follow the guidelines you've outlined.\n\nFor the `microwave_salmon()` function, we need to define the steps to microwave salmon. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\ndef microwave_salmon():\n    # 0: walk to kitchen\n    walk('kitchen')\n    # 1: find microwave\n    find('microwave')\n    # 2: open microwave\n    assert('close' to 'microwave')  \n        else: find('microwave')\n    assert('microwave' is 'closed')\n        else: close('microwave')\n    open('microwave')\n    # 3: find oventray\n    find('oventray')\n    # 4: put salmon on oventray\n    find('salmon')\n    assert('close' to 'salmon')\n        else: find('salmon')\n    grab('salmon')\n    assert('close' to 'oventray')  \n        else: find('oventray')\n    putin('salmon', 'oventray')\n    # 5: close microwave\n    assert('close' to 'microwave')  \n        else: find('microwave')\n    assert('microwave' is 'opened')\n        else: open('microwave')\n    close('microwave')\n    # 6: start microwave\n    switchon('microwave')\n    # 7: wait for salmon to cook\n    # 8: Done\n```\n\nThis function outlines the steps to microwave salmon in the kitchen. You may need to add more specific actions depending on how you want the robot to interact with the microwave and how long you want it to cook the salmon.", "watch tv": "Here's the continuation for the `watch_tv()` function:\n\n```python\ndef watch_tv():\n    # 0: walk to living room\n    walk('livingroom')\n    # 1: find TV\n    find('tv')\n    # 2: turn on TV\n    find('tv')\n    assert('close' to 'tv' )  \n        else: find('tv')\n    assert('tv' is 'switchoff' )\n        else: switchoff('tv')\n    switchon('tv')\n    # 3: sit on sofa\n    find('sofa')\n    sit('sofa')\n    # 4: watch TV\n    lookat('tv')\n    # 5: Done\n```\n\nThis function follows the same structure as the previous ones, ensuring that the robot completes the task efficiently and effectively within the context of the living room.", "turn off light": "Here's the completion for the \"turn_off_light\" function:\n\n```python\ndef turn_off_light():\n    # 0: walk to living room\n    walk('livingroom')\n    # 1: find light switch\n    find('lightswitch')\n    # 2: switch off light\n    assert('close' to 'lightswitch')\n    else: find('lightswitch')\n    switchoff('lightswitch')\n    # 3: Done\n```\n\nThis function walks to the living room, finds the light switch, and then switches it off.", "brush teeth": "It looks like you're developing a script for a household robot to perform various tasks within a home environment. The functions you've provided outline specific steps for accomplishing tasks like placing a wine glass in a kitchen cabinet, throwing away a lime, and washing a mug. These tasks involve a sequence of actions such as walking to a specific room, finding objects, grabbing them, and then performing further actions like opening/closing items or putting objects into other objects.\n\nTo continue your development, you might want to flesh out additional functions for other household activities, such as brushing teeth. Here's a basic outline for a function to simulate brushing teeth:\n\n```python\ndef brush_teeth():\n    # 0: walk to bathroom\n    walk('bathroom')\n    \n    # 1: find toothbrush\n    find('toothbrush')\n    \n    # 2: find toothpaste\n    find('toothpaste')\n    \n    # 3: grab toothbrush\n    grab('toothbrush')\n    \n    # 4: grab toothpaste\n    grab('toothpaste')\n    \n    # 5: apply toothpaste to toothbrush\n    assert('toothpaste' in 'hands')\n    puton('toothpaste', 'toothbrush')\n    \n    # 6: brush teeth\n    assert('toothbrush' in 'hands')\n    assert('sink' is 'find')\n    puttowork('toothbrush', 'sink')\n    \n    # 7: rinse toothbrush\n    assert('toothbrush' in 'hands')\n    putin('toothbrush', 'sink')\n    \n    # 8: put toothbrush back\n    assert('toothbrush' in 'hands')\n    find('toothbrush holder')\n    putback('toothbrush', 'toothbrush holder')\n    \n    # 9: Done\n```\n\nThis function assumes there are certain objects like a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a designated toothbrush holder in the bathroom. The steps include finding the necessary items, grabbing them, using them, and then putting them back in their proper place.\n\nFeel free to adapt and expand upon this outline based on the objects and actions you've defined in your script. Each function can be designed similarly, taking into account the specific room and objects required for the task.

You may need to further refine step 6 based on the specific behavior of the toaster in your environment (e.g., waiting for a certain duration or until the toast is done)."}
