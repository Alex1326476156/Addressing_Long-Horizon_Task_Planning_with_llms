{"watch tv": "To command the robot to function properly, I need to observe the relationship between the objects and their locations. After analyzing the examples provided, I can see that each action involves walking to a specified location, finding an object, and then performing an action on the object.\n\nBased on this, I can create a function to command the robot to perform the \"watch_tv\" action:\n\n```python\ndef watch_tv():\n    # 0: walk to living room\n    walk('livingroom')\n    # 1: find TV\n    find('tv')\n    # 2: turn on TV\n    assert('close' to 'tv"}
