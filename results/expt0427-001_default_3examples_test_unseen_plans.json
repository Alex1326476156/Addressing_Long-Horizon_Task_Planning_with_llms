{"eat chips on the sofa": "```python\ndef eat_chips_on_the_sofa():\n    # 0: walk to living room\n    walk('livingroom')\n    # 1: find chips\n    find('chips')\n    # 2: grab chips\n    assert('close' to 'chips')\n    else: find('chips')\n    grab('chips')\n    # 3: find sofa\n    find('sofa')\n    # 4: sit on sofa\n    sit('sofa')\n    # 5: start eating chips\n    # 6: Done\n```\n\nHere's a function to eat chips on the sofa. I've followed the instructions provided and used the actions available to complete the task efficiently within the living room environment. Let me know if you need further assistance!", "watch tv": "Here's the continuation for the `watch_tv()` function:\n\n```python\ndef watch_tv():\n    # 0: walk to living room\n    walk('livingroom')\n    # 1: find TV\n    find('tv')\n    # 2: turn on TV\n    find('tv')\n    assert('close' to 'tv' )  \n    else: find('tv')\n    assert('tv' is 'switchoff' )\n    else: switchoff('tv')\n    switchon('tv')\n    # 3: Done\n```\n\nThis function allows the robot to walk to the living room, find the TV, and then turn it on. Remember, the `assert` statements ensure that the robot only performs actions when necessary conditions are met.", "turn off light": "It looks like you're implementing some tasks for a household robot. To continue with the `turn_off_light()` function, let's assume the robot needs to turn off a light in a room. Here's how you could structure the function:\n\n```python\ndef turn_off_light():\n    # 0: find light switch\n    find('lightswitch')\n    \n    # 1: switch off the light\n    assert('lightswitch' in 'room')\n        else: find('lightswitch')\n    switchoff('lightswitch')\n    \n    # 2: Done\n```\n\nThis function first finds the light switch in the current room and then switches it off. Remember to define the `find()` and `switchoff()` functions if you haven't already, and make sure to handle any edge cases or error conditions appropriately.", "brush teeth": "It seems like you're in the process of defining functions for various tasks a household robot might perform. You've already covered putting a wine glass in the kitchen cabinet, throwing away a lime, and washing a mug. What task would you like to tackle next?", "throw away apple": "It looks like you're building a script for a household robot to perform various tasks. You've already defined functions for putting a wine glass in the kitchen cabinet, throwing away a lime, and washing a mug. Would you like help completing the `throw_away_apple()` function?", "make toast": "For the `make_toast()` function, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Walk to kitchen**: This step seems to be common in many tasks involving kitchen activities, so we'll include it here.\n2. **Find bread slice**: The robot needs to locate a bread slice, which could typically be found in the kitchen, on the kitchen counter, or in the bread box.\n3. **Find toaster**: Toasters are usually found on the kitchen counter or in a specific cabinet designated for kitchen appliances.\n4. **Put bread slice in toaster**: Once the bread slice is located and the toaster is found, the robot should put the bread slice into the toaster.\n5. **Turn on toaster**: The robot needs to activate the toaster to start toasting the bread.\n6. **Wait for toasting**: Depending on the toaster settings, the robot should wait for the bread to toast properly.\n7. **Take out toasted bread**: Once the toasting is complete, the robot should remove the toasted bread from the toaster.\n8. **Put toasted bread on plate**: The toasted bread should be placed on a plate or any suitable surface for serving.\n\nNow, let's translate these steps into code:\n\n```python\ndef make_toast():\n    # 0: walk to kitchen\n    walk('kitchen')\n    \n    # 1: find bread slice\n    find('breadslice')\n    grab('breadslice')\n    \n    # 2: find toaster\n    find('toaster')\n    \n    # 3: put bread slice in toaster\n    putin('breadslice', 'toaster')\n    \n    # 4: turn on toaster\n    switchon('toaster')\n    \n    # 5: wait for toasting (assuming a delay)\n    # [Add code here for waiting]\n    \n    # 6: take out toasted bread\n    find('toaster')\n    grab('breadslice')\n    \n    # 7: put toasted bread on plate\n    find('plate')\n    putin('breadslice', 'plate')\n    \n    # 8: Done\n```\n\nThis code assumes some details like waiting for the toasting process to complete, which might involve timing or sensor checks."}
