This is a framework for long-horizon task planning using large language models (LLMs) and the VirtualHome simulation environment. It enables intelligent agents to decompose complex tasks, optimize action sequences, and adapt to dynamic environments.

# Setup

1. Create a conda environment:`conda create -n myenv python==3.9`
2. Install dependencies:`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Clone [VirtualHome](https://github.com/xavierpuigf/virtualhome) and install it by running

# How to run

1. Update  your `openai-apikey`. [Developer quickstart - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?api-mode=chat)
2. Configure parameters in the scripts.
